ü§ñ What is MLOps?
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of automating and managing the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning projects, just like DevOps for software engineering.

Think of it as the bridge between model development and real-world deployment

Phase	Involves
Data Engineering	   |    Collecting, cleaning, and versioning datasets
Model Development	   |    Training models, tuning hyperparameters
Model Validation	   |    Ensuring models work properly (testing, metrics)
CI/CD	Automating     |    testing and deployment with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins
Deployment	Making     |     the model available via APIs (Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
Monitoring	Tracking   |     model accuracy, latency, drift, usage
Retraining Pipelines   |    Automatically retraining models with new data

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used in MLOps
Step	            |   Tools/Libraries
Data Versioning	    |   DVC, LakeFS, Delta Lake
Model Tracking	    |   MLflow, Weights & Biases
Deployment	        |   Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes
CI/CD Pipelines	    |   GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI
Monitoring   	    |   Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry
Cloud Platforms	    |   AWS, GCP, Azure, Vertex AI

üß† Why MLOps is Important
Without MLOps:

Code and models become hard to reproduce

Deployments are manual, error-prone, and slow

It's hard to track performance and detect when models fail or drift

With MLOps:

Teams ship models faster with fewer bugs

You can automate testing, deployment, and monitoring

You create scalable, repeatable, and reliable ML systems


‚öôÔ∏è What Are CI/CD Pipelines?
TermStands For	Meaning
CI:	Continuous Integration	Automatically test and combine new code changes

CD: Continuous Delivery / Deployment	Automatically deploy tested code to production

‚úÖ In simple words:
CI/CD pipelines automate everything from code commit to deployment, so you don‚Äôt have to do it manually every time.

üß± Example: CI/CD in a Machine Learning Project
Let‚Äôs say you have a Flask app serving a machine learning model.

Here‚Äôs what CI/CD does:

üîπ 1. CI (Continuous Integration)
When you push your code to GitHub:

‚úÖ Code is automatically tested (e.g., using pytest)

‚úÖ Model or app is linted (checked for errors)

‚úÖ A Docker image is built

üîπ 2. CD (Continuous Deployment)
If the tests pass:

‚úÖ The Flask app is deployed to a server or cloud (like Render, Heroku, AWS)

‚úÖ Or, the Docker image is pushed to DockerHub

üß∞ Tools Used in CI/CD
Tool	Role
GitHub Actions	Automate testing, building, and deployment when you git push
Jenkins	More customizable CI/CD system
Docker	Package your app into a consistent environment
Heroku / Render / AWS	Host your app automatically
Kubernetes	For scaling and advanced orchestration

GitHub Actions is a built-in automation tool in GitHub that helps you automatically run tasks like:

Testing code

Building Docker images

Deploying apps

Running CI/CD pipelines

All of this happens whenever you push code to GitHub, open a pull request, or trigger a custom event.
