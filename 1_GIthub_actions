Github is code repository that we use to work in collarative way
Git it is distributed version control system :
here we able to track source code file 




|----------------------|
|                      |
|      Project         | <dev 1 |
|                      | <dev 2 |-- working in a collabrative way
|                      | <dev 3 |
|                      |
|----------------------| 
                        
switch braches and merging branches we use git

git hub action are ci | cd tool

countinous integration and countinous deployment 


eg a machine learning project 
story a   
story b   
story c    

                        
                    |-------------------------------|
[ Git repo ] <--->[Dev]-->[Quality Assurance] --> [ User Acceptance Testing]-->[production]





WOrks flows : a developer work flow refers to the series of steps , practices and tools that a developer of a team of developers follows to write , test , collaborate and deployment efficently


Keys steps :
1 > coding : vs code etc : python , java etc : coding standard , best practice 

2 > Version control : Git : manage the code base : allow multiple devloper to collab
.commit 
.branches 
.push
.pull
.resolve conflict

3> code review :help to improve code quality 

4> testing 
.automated testing 
1.unit testing
2.integrated testing
3.end to end testing

5> Countinous integration (CI) : 
building ,testing , notified , fixing

6>Countinues deveploment
