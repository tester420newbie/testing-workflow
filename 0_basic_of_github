if there U in front of any file name it mean its a untraced file 
we have to git add to know how may time changes has been done in it 

Commit :
we add it into a staging environment : 
it is a temprary environment where we put the code 

now we rename our branch into main

then we add it to destination url 

if we write  . only after add it will all files or if we write name then it will addd that file only


if there m in front of file it mean the file is modified but not added

while pushing its important to leave a messege by -m

if we dont want to select a file with . we add it to git ignore folder :
that we create directly in git 
we write the file name in :
bite compilied / optimized / Dll file 
like : file name /
